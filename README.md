#🌊 River & Lake Garbage Detection – AI for Cleaner Water
##📝 Overview
This AI-powered solution detects and classifies floating garbage in rivers and lakes using a machine learning model. By analyzing live camera feeds, the system can identify waste in real time, enabling proactive cleanup efforts and environmental monitoring.

##✨ Features
✅ Real-time Detection: Processes live camera feeds to identify segregated garbage instantly.
✅ Object Classification: Differentiates between plastic and non-plastic type of waste for efficient categorization.
✅ Deep Learning Model: Utilizes YOLOv8 model for accurate predictions.
✅ Edge & Cloud Deployment: Can run on local edge devices or be integrated with cloud-based platforms.
✅ Environmental Monitoring: Provides continuous surveillance for pollution control and cleanup planning.

##⚙️ Components and Working
🔹 Live Feed Processing: Captures video data from cameras positioned along water bodies.
🔹 Preprocessing Pipeline: Enhances frames, filters noise, and extracts relevant image features.
🔹 ML Model Inference: Applies a trained deep learning model to classify garbage in real time.
🔹 Alert System: Generates reports and alerts for cleanup teams based on detection results.
🔹 Deployment Flexibility: Supports integration with IoT devices, edge AI hardware, and cloud services.

##📊 Results
The model achieves high accuracy in detecting floating waste, helping authorities take timely action to reduce water pollution.

##🛠️ Installation and Usage
🔹Download best_1.pt into your device.
🔹Now to test if it runs, you can use a code excerpt that checks model availability.
🔹Now, you can feed a video and see the classifications it makes.

##⚙️ Technical Details
🔹Uses Python for coding the ML part
🔹For the chip to use in the boat, RasberryPi should be used as it has depth knowledge and works on lazers.
