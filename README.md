This is the code for the model creation for River Garbage tracker using YOLOv8
->To create your own model:
->Create a roboflow account and creat a dataset of images which are to be trained
->Download the zip file for it and save it in the folder you are coding in
->Download required dependencies for running the libraries YOLO and Ultralytics
->Ensure you have CUDA in your device, else processing will be slow or can also be damaged.
